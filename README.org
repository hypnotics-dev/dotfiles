* Linux Dotfiles & Rices

A repository containing any custom configuration/ricing that I wish to be shared.

Top level directories (other than other/) are configs for my daily drivers. 

The intended way to use this repository is to symlink the files or directories you wish to use to their destination.

Example for using my neovim config
#+begin_src sh
  ln -s "$(pwd)/editor/nvim" ~/.config/nvim
#+end_src

* TODOs [0/2] [0%]

- [ ] Write a README for each package
- [ ] add the other/ and rice/ directories
